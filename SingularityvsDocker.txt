Singularity is used when you donâ€™t want to give superuser access to all 
users, mostly used by scientific application users. The mobility of 
compute 
of Singularity allows researchers to run their workflows anywhere, and 
very suitable on HPC. Docker is used to wrap the piece of software in a 
complete filesystem that has everything to run and he performance is 
always the same no matter of its environment. Developers use it often to 
present their work.
